This is the final project for my PHP class. This is a Wordpress addon that allows the user to pull the five most recent tweets from their twitter account and displaying in on their Wordpress page. This is done by connecting to the twitter account using TwitterOAuth, verifying the account then getting the information that will be posted onto the Wordpress page.
